The idea is to generate a visualize the packages and its classes, so it looks like:

According to that article, it was created using the following:

For those interested in how we built this visualization, it involved multiple steps.
We started with Gephi, an open-source network analysis and visualization software package, by importing a pair-wise
comma-separated list of skills and their similarity scores (as Simon described in his article) and running a number
of analyses: Force Atlas layout to draw a force-directed graph, Avg. Path Length to calculate the Betweenness
Centrality that determines the size of a node, and finally Modularity to detect communities of skills
(again, color-coded in the visualization).

Once the graph was the way we wanted, we exported it as an XML graph file (GEXF) and converted it to JSON format,
with two sets of elements: Nodes and links. It was then a matter of leveraging D3 to visualize the data as a network.
