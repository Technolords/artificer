- Discover how sequence diagrams can be extracted (i.e. what stateful data must be preserved)

- Export referenced classes in the XML output

- Discover how to source all attributes from XML spec into attribute reading

- Implement all cases for the SignatureAnalyser

- Implement combination of all referenced resources per jar (kind of finalize?)

-------------------------

- compile list of se classes and ee classes
    - decide which class keeps this state

- extend roadmap with
    techno-tools
        artificer                                       -> generates data
        artificer-javadoc                               -> generates presentation
        artificer-camel-route                           -> generates presentation

- keep track of annotations??

- keep track of invoked methods?? -> derive sequence diagrams
